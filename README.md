Our team will use Genetic Algorithm to slove the travaling salesman problem
# Problem Description
Suppose a travel businessman wants to visit n cities. He must choose the path to be taken. The limit of the path is that each city can only visit once, The path selection goal is that the required path distance is the minimum of all paths.

This problem can be described by a graph
V={C1,C2....} is a set of cities. Ci represents the i-th city
E={(r,s):r,s∈V} is a set of connection between all cities
C={crs:r,s∈V} is a set of distance for the connection between all cities
So the tsp problem can be translate as:
Solving the traversal graph G = (V, E, C), all nodes are once and return to the starting node, making the path cost connecting these nodes the lowest.
